# EFC Estimator

This app is a desktop webapp that allows people to fill in some simple data to get an estimated financial contribution based on income and finance data. No personal information is collected or saved anywhere. It's simply an automation of the FAFSA EFC formula located [here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/2017-18-efc-formula.pdf).
